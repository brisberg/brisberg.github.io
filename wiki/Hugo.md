# Hugo

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a Static-Site-Generator written in [Go](https://golang.org/). It claims to be the fastest SSG there is because it is based on Golang's templating libraries.

It can be used to generate beautiful static websites and comes with a number of themes to choose from.

See [Wiki](https://wiki.brisberg.dev/docs/hugo) for more information.
