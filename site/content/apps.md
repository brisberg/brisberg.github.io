## Friday Fellows Updater

[Friday Fellows Updater](https://friday-fellows.brisberg.dev) is an [open source](https://github.com/brisberg/friday-fellows-gcf) web application to track and manage the Anime watch history of my friends from Anime Club.

## Twine Games

I love the concept of online interactive fiction and created some  [simple games](https://brisberg.dev/twine-games) using [Twine](https://twinery.org/):

- ##### Cellar Crawl - [Play](https://brisberg.dev/twine-games/cellar-crawl)
  - Explore the dark cellar beneith a creepy house to discover its secret.

- ##### Journey - [Play](https://brisberg.dev/twine-games/journey)
  - Travel the high seas, overcoming challenges in an Oregon Trail inspired game.
