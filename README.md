# brisberg.github.io

Root pages hosting for all of `brisberg.dev`.

This should be updated to include links to all my projects, links to my blog, contact info, github presence.

Specifically this should be an index of my other online content, not necessisarily specific to GitHub but related. Not specifically about any blog posts, which will be hosted elsewhere.

## Framework

I should look into using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as my site generator, using [Minimal](https://github.com/calintat/minimal) theme. Inspiration https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/.

There might be other themes, and I could customize it a bit. But it will include social media, blog, projects, wiki, etc.
